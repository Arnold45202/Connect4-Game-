Hey This is write up which would documents the thought process and the coding error I get when i'm making this website

21/12/2023 

this is the first day of my docummenting my code for my website aka first project

so i uploaded on this 000webhost where i have two games which are tic tac toe and connect4,also i have a game review page which allows
random people that plays the game to review about it, but i need to make a backend for it which would store the files for it 

i'm trying to keep the colour and the css consistent between all my games and my whole website

ERRORS TO BE FIXED:
connect4 right now for connect 4 it requires to have a number to be inputed but i think it should be buttons on the bottom like 7 buttons at the bottom,
which would allow it to be better for the user, 

for connect4 and tictactoe i think i should have a text at the top which would show who's turn it is because right now its just red start first for connect4
and for tic tac toe X starts first
